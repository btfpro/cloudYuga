#this project is all about cloud

# Angular Express Seed

This is an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node on the back. 



_Note: Although Jade supports interpolation, you should be doing that mostly on the client. Mixing
server and browser templating will convolute your app. Instead, use Jade as a syntactic sugar for
HTML, and let AngularJS take care of interpolation on the browser side._
